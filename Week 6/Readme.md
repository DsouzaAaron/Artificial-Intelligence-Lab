## MULTI-ARMED BANDITS – AD OPTIMIZATION 

Consider the given dataset “Ads_clicks” containing data about which add was clicked in each 
time step. Suppose an advertising company is running 10 different ads targeted towards a 
similar set of the population on a webpage. We have results for which ads were clicked by a user 
Each column index represents a different ad. We have a 1 if the ad was clicked by a user, and 0 if 
it was not. <br>

A. Write down the MAB agent problem formulation in your own words.<br> 

B. Compute the total rewards after 2000-time steps using the ε-greedy action. a. for ε=0.01, ε= 
0.3 <br>

C. Compute the total rewards after 2000-time steps using the Upper-Confidence-Bound action 
method for c= 1.5 <br>

D. For all approaches, explain how the action value estimated compares to the optimal action.
